Do you know the Vimperator add-in for Firefox? I didn' t at least until
today. It's an amazing piece of software that lets you control the
browser completely by keyboard with the control scheme known from the
famous VI editor. It's an open source project and can be found
[here](http://vimperator.mozdev.org). I haven't had the 'pleasure' to
work with VI in the past, so the start was a bit hard for me. But after
half an hour fighting to the documentation and playing with the control
scheme it feels really easy. Here is a list of commands I currently use
(and obviously need to remember :-)):

-   :open url, opens the link in the current tab. (f.e.: :open bjro.de)
-   :tabopen url, opens the link in a new tab. (f.e.: :tabopen bjro.de)
-   :tabd for duplicating the current tab
-   ctrl + i , to go back in the browser history
-   ctrl + o, to forward in the browser history
-   :q for closing the current tab.
-   strg+p for switching to the previous tab.
-   strg+n for switching to the next tab.
-   f for highlighting all links in the document. Typing the link number
    will navigate to that link in the same page.
-   F for highlighting all links in the document. Typing the link number
    will navigate to that link in a new tab.
-   :bmark for bookmarking the currently displayed page-
-   :bmarks for showing a list of all bookmarks.
-   j for scrolling down.
-   k for scrolling up.
-   h for scrolling left.
-   l for scrolling right.

Give the tool a try. It's really fun . . .
