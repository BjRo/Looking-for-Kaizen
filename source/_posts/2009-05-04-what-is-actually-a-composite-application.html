'Composite application' is one of those terms you talk endlessly with other developers about, only to find out that each of them has a totally different understanding of what the term actually means. If you try to google it you'll find several definitions ranging from 'a solution stitched composed of loosely coupled  semi-independent components' over 'application built by combining multiple existing functions into a new application' over 'business mashups' to 'frontends to a Service Oriented Architecture'.

Just to be clear, I like none of those definitions and I won't give you a formal definition either. Instead I would like to take quick look at the key differences (as I see them) between composite applications and conventional architectures.

If take a look at how software developers &amp; architects deal with complexity IMHO it mostly boils down to two things: 1. Decomposition and 2. Integration.  Complex problems get broken down into handier pieces which can be solved more easily. We apply this divide-and-conquer-strategy at multiple levels (classes, algorithms, components, layers, tiers, just to name a few).  We do this to achieve all sort of things like maintainability, reversibility, testability, etc. However, in order to have a working solution you need to reintegrate all those parts and that integration aspect for me personally is one of the main differences between conventional and composite architectures:
<ul>
	<li> Integration in conventional architectures is performed in a static way, mainly by the compiler but also by deployment tools (f.e. ILMerge).</li>
	<li>Compared to that, integration in composite architectures is more or less dynamic. It's performed at runtime by some kind of integration architecture with a kernel built around the concept of dependency inversion. When inspecting composite applications you'll very often find a host-process which dynamically loads modules and a container based infrastructure which does the actual low level composition. This container can be an actual Inversion-of-Control-container, but this isn't a must. The Managed Extensibility Framework for instance is able to achieve similar things.</li>
</ul>
Besides that, another aspect really important to composite architecture is the <strong>Open-Closed-Principle applied to architecture</strong>. OCP was originally formulated by Uncle Bob Martin as "<em>software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification</em>". What does this mean to architecture? It basically means that you're able extend your host environment without having the need to recompile it. This can range from adding a new module to the system, over registering new business capabilities to extending the UI of host environment (which is called the shell).

So far I've talked a bit about the IMHO typical aspects of composite applications, but not why you might want to use such an architecture and what possible benefits of such an architecture might be. I guess this is worth an own post, so I'll spare that for now . . . .
