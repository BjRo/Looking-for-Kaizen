. . . or how one could implement the It-Syntax introduced by MSpec. If you don't know what the hell I'm talking about take a look at this code. (I don't know if that's the current MSpec syntax but I think you'll get where I'd like to take you . . . )

[sourcecode language="csharp"]
[Description]
public class Transferring_between_from_account_and_to_account
{
  static Account fromAccount;
  static Account toAccount;

  Context before_each =()=>
  {
    fromAccount = new Account {Balance = 1m};
    toAccount = new Account {Balance = 1m};
  };
  
  When the_transfer_is_made =()=>
  {
    fromAccount.Transfer(1m, toAccount);
  };
   
  It should_debit_the_from_account_by_the_amount_transferred =()=>
  {
    fromAccount.Balance.ShouldEqual(0m);
  };

  It should_credit_the_to_account_by_the_amount_transferred =()=>
  {
    toAccount.Balance.ShouldEqual(2m);
  };
}

What you'll see in this post is part of a spike I did some month ago<a href="http://www.bjoernrochel.de/2008/11/27/a-new-syntax-for-xunitbddextensions/" target="_blank"> while I was considering</a> to move the xUnit.BDDExtensions syntax to something more GWT and MSpec like. I finally decided against that, partially because I realized that there is absolutely no need for a MSpec-Clone; partially because I'm still not so happy with the implications / side effects of the syntax (nearly everything in you spec needs to become static).

Anyway, <a href="http://blog.jpboodhoo.com/SlightAdditionToJpboodhoobdd.aspx" target="_blank">recently</a> JP Boodhoo introduced the same feature to his Jpboodhoo.bdd codebase. A lot of the comments requested a more detailed description of how he implemented that feature. While I can't answer that question, I can talk about how I tackled that problem. So here we go!

<strong>Some prerequisites first</strong>

If you wonder how such a sweet syntax is possible in C#,  here are some clues: 
<ul>
  <li>
It uses fields with ommited access modifiers (therefore private fields). 
</li>
<li>
It, When, etc. are delegate types. 
</li>
<li>
Field-initializers are used to specifiy the delegates inline. (and because Field-Initializers are run before the constructor you can only access static and no instance members here. Thats the sideeffect I mentioned earlier).
</li>
</ul>

<strong>A closer look at my spike</strong>

The following class is the heart of the spike I implemented. It takes a blank object and uses reflection to build an ISpecHandler instance which is ultimately used to run the specification.

[sourcecode language="csharp"]
    public class SpecFactory : ISpecFactory
    {
    	public ISpecHandler CreateSpecFrom(object candidate)
        {
            var fields = candidate.AllFields();

            return fields.AllFixtureInitializers()
                .Then(fields.AllContextInitializers())
                .Then(fields.AllContextFinalizers())
                .Then(fields.BehaviorUnderTest())
                .Then(fields.AllObservations())
                .ThenFinally(fields.AllFixtureCleaners());
        }
    }
[/sourcecode]

As you might guess a lot of extension methods are used in here, together with the composite pattern. Lets start be inspecting the AllFields() extension method.

[sourcecode language="csharp"]
        public static IEnumerable<IFieldInfo> AllFields(this object instance)
        {
            var mask = BindingFlags.Instance |
                       BindingFlags.Static |
                       BindingFlags.NonPublic |
                       BindingFlags.FlattenHierarchy;

            return instance
                .GetType()
                .GetFields(mask)
                .Select<FieldInfo, IFieldInfo>(x => new FieldInfoAdapter(x, instance));
        }
[/sourcecode]

As its name implies this method reflects all the fields from the supplied object. It returns a collection of IFieldInfo objects. IFieldInfo? Yes I introduced a little adapter here, which helped me to introduce better test isolation in the spike code. 

[sourcecode language="csharp"]
    public class FieldInfoAdapter : IFieldInfo
    {
        private readonly FieldInfo fieldInfo;
        private readonly object host;

        public FieldInfoAdapter(FieldInfo fieldInfo, object host)
        {
            this.fieldInfo = fieldInfo;
            this.host = host;
        }

        public object ReadValue()
        {
            return fieldInfo.GetValue(host);
        }

        public Type FieldType
        {
            get { return fieldInfo.FieldType; }
        }

        public string Name
        {
            get { return fieldInfo.Name; }
        }
    }
[/sourcecode]

And here is how the code that finds all the It delegates was implemented.

[sourcecode language="csharp"]
public static ISpecHandler AllObservations(this IEnumerable<IFieldInfo> fields)
{
    return fields.AllHandlersOf().AsOne();
}

 private static IEnumerable AllHandlersOf<HandlerType>(this IEnumerable<IFieldInfo> fields)
 {
      return fields
           .Where(field => field.FieldType == typeof(HandlerType)  &amp;amp;amp;&amp;amp;amp; !field.Name.StartsWith("CS$"))
           .Select<IFieldInfo, ISpecHandler>(field => new SpecHandler((Delegate)field.ReadValue()));
 }

  private static ISpecHandler AsOne(this IEnumerable<ISpecHandler> specHandler)
  {
        return new CompositeSpecHandler(specHandler);
  }

[/sourcecode]

The basic stuff happens in the AllHandlersOf method which filters the supplied fields by the fieldtype and also removes all compiler generated fields (which start with "CS$" in their names). The content (aka the delegate) of each field that is left is read and wrapped in a SpecHandler instance. 

[sourcecode language="csharp"]
    public class SpecHandler : ISpecHandler
    {
        private readonly Delegate handler;

        public SpecHandler(Delegate handler)
        {
            this.handler = handler;
        }

        public void Run()
        {
            try
            {
                handler.DynamicInvoke();
            }
            catch (TargetInvocationException e)
            {
                throw e.InnerException.PreserveStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
[/sourcecode]

Last but not least there is the Then extension method which uses the composite pattern to wrap all found spec handlers into a single instance.

[sourcecode language="csharp"]
 public static ISpecHandler Then(this ISpecHandler handler, ISpecHandler handlerToRunAfterwards)
        {
            return new CompositeSpecHandler(new[]
            {
                handler,
                handlerToRunAfterwards
            });
        }

[/sourcecode]

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

It's not as hard to implement such a syntax in C# as one might initially think. Although the code shown in this post is only spike code and not considered production ready, you can derive all what's necessary to implement such a syntax. Fields, omitted access modifiers, Field-Initializers and Delegates are the basic parts together with some reflection logic to execute the code.
