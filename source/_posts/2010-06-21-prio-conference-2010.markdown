In case you haven’t heard it yet, I’m going to give 2 talks at this years [prio conference](http://www.prioconference.de/ "prio. conference").     

![prio conference logo]({{ root_url }}/images/posts/prioSpreaker-Banner.gif "Prio conference 2010")

I’m very exited to be part of [this years speaker line up](http://www.prioconference.de/Speaker/Speaker-prio.conference-2010 "prio 2010 speakers") (though the quality of the line up is a bit intimidating ;-)).
Both talks will be on the [20th of October in Track 4](http://www.prioconference.de/Programm/Programm-prio.conference-20.-Oktober-2010/prio.conference-Track-32) 

* 10.05 – 11.05h, Introduction to Rhino.ServiceBus
* 15.20h – 16.20h, (ServiceBus) Patters for always responsive clients

Looking forward to see you there . . .
