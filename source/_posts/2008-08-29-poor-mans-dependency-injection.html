While watching the first of JP Boodhoos screencast series I discovered that a concept that I used in order to introduce testing to developers who work mostly in legacy code (I'm using Michael Feathers terminology here) is in fact a well known pattern.

Let me give you an example. You've got a class that you want test, but this class somehow depends on an untestable resource like for instance a webservice. You don't have some kind of dependency inversion to you're hand and have to solve this problem on your own. A short example:

[sourcecode language="csharp"]
public class BillingService
{
      public BillingResult DoBilling(BillingData data)
      {
            Bill theBil = MakeBill(data);
   
            using(BillingClient wc = new BillingClient())
            {
                 wc.DoBilling(theBil);
            }
      }
}
[/sourcecode]

What I mostly recommend in such a situation is
<ol>
	<li>Extract or isolate the ugly (Quote from Jeremy Miller) which is the webservice call here.</li>
	<li>Introduce an interface that shields the class from the webservice call.</li>
	<li>Make the whole class rely on the abstraction.</li>
	<li>Use two constructors. I mostly reffered to them as the opened and the closed constructor.</li>
</ol>

[sourcecode language="csharp"]
public class BillingService
{
      private IBillingSystem _BillingSystem;

      public BillingService(IBillingSystem billingSystem)
      {
             _BillingSystem = billingSystem;
      }

      public BillingSystem() : this(new BillingSystem())
      {
      }

      public BillingResult DoBilling(BillingData data)
      {
            Bill theBill = MakeBill(data);
   
            _BillingSystem.DoBilling();
      }
}

public interface IBillingSystem
{
      void DoBilling(Bill theBill);
}

public class BillingSystem : IBillingSystem
{
      public void DoBilling(Bill theBill)
      {
            using(BillingClient wc = new BillingClient())
            {
                 wc.DoBilling(theBill);
            }
      }
}
[/sourcecode]

With that you can easily replace the untestable code with some kind of testdouble like a stub or a mock.

[sourcecode language="csharp"]
public class BillingServiceTest
{
     [Fact]
     public void DoBilling_ValidBill_BillIsCorrectlySendToBillingSystem()
     {
           BillingSystemStub billingSystem =  new BillingSystemStub();
           BillingService billingService = new BillingService(billingSystem);
           BillingData billingData = MakeValidBillingData();

           billingService.DoBilling(billingData);

           //Do some assertions
           Assert.NotNull(billingSystem.RecievedBill);
     }
}
[/sourcecode]

Today I learned that this is also called POOR MANS DEPENDENCY INJECTION.

P.S.: 
Mabe the example is not the best one but I didn't want to go into something like  Foo and Bar again. Besides that it's only a simplified example. Consider that before throwing eggs and tomatos at me :-).

P.S.2: 
An alternative to this approach which doesn't require a new interface is "Extract &amp; Override".
