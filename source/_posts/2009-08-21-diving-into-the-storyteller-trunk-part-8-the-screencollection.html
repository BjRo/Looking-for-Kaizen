Welcome back again to the "Diving into the StoryTeller trunk" series. Got your diving suit on? If so, good. If not: Suit-up! (Sorry, the HIMYM fanboy in me was too strong ;-))
</p>
Last time we spend some time with the concept of Screens. Screens more or less provide the content of an application. Content needs to be displayed somewhere and that's where the ScreenCollection concept comes into play.
<p>
In abstract a ScreenCollection is a container for multiple Screens. It's used to display screens. The ScreenCollection concept is comparable to PRISMs Regions or CABs WorkSpaces. It doesn't really contain a lot of intelligence. It only allows you to add a Screen, remove a Screen, getting all Screens in the container, make a Screen the active one. You know, all in all the typical stuff you would expect from a collection (maybe except the last one). The ScreenCollection contract is represented by the IScreenCollection interface which looks like this:

[sourcecode language="csharp"]

        public interface IScreenCollection
       {
             void ClearAll();
             IScreen Active { get; }	
             void Show(IScreen screen);
             void Add(IScreen screen);
             void Remove(IScreen screen);
             IEnumerable<IScreen> AllScreens { get; }
             void RenameTab(IScreen screen, string name);
        }

[/sourcecode] 

If take a closer look at the interface you've probably recognized the last method which doesn't really fit in there. Let's spare that discussion for a moment. I'm going to comment on that in a moment.
<p />
StoryTeller contains only one implementation for the IScreenCollection interface, which is called (what-a-surprise) ScreenCollection.  This class simply wraps around a standard WPF TabControl. Let's take a look at how this is implemented, starting with the constructor.

[sourcecode language="csharp"]
    public class ScreenCollection : IScreenCollection
    {
        private readonly Cache<IScreen, StoryTellerTabItem> _tabItems = new Cache<IScreen, StoryTellerTabItem>();
        private readonly TabControl _tabs;

        public ScreenCollection(TabControl tabs, IEventAggregator events)
        {
            _tabs = tabs;
            _tabItems.OnMissing = screen => new StoryTellerTabItem(screen, events);
            _tabs.SelectionChanged += (s, c) => { events.SendMessage<UserScreenActivation>(); };
	    
	    // Hack.  Sigh.
            events.AddListener(new RenameTestHandler(new ScreenFinder(this), this));
        }

	...
    }
[/sourcecode]

There're are two interesting things to notice here. The ScreenCollection uses a cache concept in order to correlate Screens and the TabItems used to display them. The Cache&lt;TKey,TValue&gt; class is a smart wrapper around an IDictionary&lt;TKey,TValue&gt;  which (besides some other functionality) allows you to plug-in a custom handler which is called when no value is found for the specified key. This handler acts as a kind of value factory. That's exactly what we see when we take a look at the line with _tabItems.OnMissing. Each time a Screen is not found in the cache StoryTeller creates a new StoryTellerTabItem.
<p>
The other interesting thing to notice is that the ScreenCollection doesn't directly expose events but rather uses the Eventbroker for this. You can see this at the UserScreenActivation message.
</p>
Yeah and then there is the "RenameTab" thing. It's marked as a hack. It simply shouldn't be there. The problem it currently solves it that when a test is renamed the related TabHeader must also be updated (We take a look at the TabItem in a moment). I wonder whether this isn't something that could be done in a cleaner way using WPF databinding on Screen.Title instead. 
<p />
Lets take a look at how the cache magic is used. It's really compact code. Most of the methods are one or two liners.

[sourcecode language="csharp"]

        public void ClearAll()
        {
            _tabs.Items.Clear();
        }

        public void Show(IScreen screen)
        {
            _tabs.SelectedItem = _tabItems[screen];
        }

        public void Add(IScreen screen)
        {
            _tabs.Items.Add(_tabItems[screen]);
        }

        public void Remove(IScreen screen)
        {
            TabItem tabItem = _tabItems[screen];
            _tabItems.Remove(screen);
            _tabs.Items.Remove(tabItem);
        }

        public IEnumerable<IScreen> AllScreens { get { return new List<IScreen>(_tabItems.Keys()); } }

[/sourcecode]

The cache class is used like you would use a good old Hashtable. All in all I think I don't need to say more here.  Here is the code for determining the active Screen.

[sourcecode language="csharp"]

        public IScreen Active
        {
            get
            {
                if (_tabs.SelectedItem != null) return toScreen(_tabs.SelectedItem);

                return null;
            }
        }

        private IScreen toScreen(object tab)
        {
            return tab.As<TabItem>().Tag.As<IScreen>();
        }

[/sourcecode]

Last but not least here's the code for the TabItem which is build around a screen.

[sourcecode language="csharp"]

    public class StoryTellerTabItem : TabItem
    {
        private Label _label;

        public StoryTellerTabItem(IScreen screen, IEventAggregator events)
        {
            Func<Action<IScreenConductor>, Action> sendMessage = a => () => events.SendMessage(a);

            Header = new StackPanel().Horizontal()
                .AddText(screen.Title, x => _label = x)
                .IconButton(Icon.Close, sendMessage(s => s.Close(screen)), b => b.SmallerImages());

            Content = new DockPanel().With(screen.View);
            Tag = screen;


            ContextMenu = new ContextMenu().Configure(o =>
            {
                o.AddItem("Close", sendMessage(s => s.Close(screen)));
                o.AddItem("Close All But This", sendMessage(s => s.CloseAllBut(screen)));
                o.AddItem("Close All", sendMessage(s => s.CloseAll()));
            });
        }

        public string HeaderText { get { return _label.Content as string; } set { _label.Content = value; } }
    }
[/sourcecode]

I need to talk more about this part, don't I? 

Again two intersting things here. First thing, it really makes heavy usage of C#3.0. You can see a lot of Extension Methods on WPF classes used in order to build and configure WPF elements in a very fluent and compact way.
<p>
Besides that you see here again how the EventBroker can be nicely integrated into Screen handling. Take a look at the context menu of each TabItem. It provides handlers which call directly into the EventBroker for triggering the typical close operations you can also see in Visual Studio. The important thing here to take away is that the close operations are only triggered here but performed by the IScreenConductor. 
</p>
For those of you who didn't follow my "StoryTeller" investigations from the start: The  ScreenConductor is the great coordinator for the Screen Activation Lifecycle behind the scenes. It's (as far as I can tell) the central facade to the Screen Activation Lifecyle from the perspective of typical application code. The ScreenConductor is a big topic which will be discussed in one of the next posts.
<p>
<b>Closing thoughts</b>
</p>
Lets not comment on the RenameTab thing, ok? I bet, Jeremy is going to fix that pretty soon. The ScreenCollection is (again) a good example of how much you can do with so few lines. However sometimes this can have downsides, too. I can only imagine .NET developers unfamiliar with
this heavy usage of C#3.0 features staring at the code and thinking something like: WTF, what's happening here? Personally, I like it, especially the cache aspect of it. I've done the .Tag thing far too often now. 
<p>
Sadly one thing I would have loved to see is missing in the code, the ability to block deactivation or activation. Typical example for this is a requirement forcing the user to save or discard changed data before leaving a Screen. I had this requirement in the last 5 applications I worked on. It would have been interesting to see how Jeremy tackles such a requirement. I'm just assuming that he would use the EventBroker for that ...
</p>
Enought Screen Mania for today. I hope you've enjoyed the ride so far and we'll rejoin next time when it's time to take a look at the big guy in the game, the ScreenConductor.
