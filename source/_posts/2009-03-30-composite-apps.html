I'm currently in the process of preparing material for a workshop at my current client. The workshop will be  mainly focused on implementing client-side Composite Apps with the Composite UI Application Block / SCSF but it'll also contain a large portion about Composite Apps in general.

While the CAB / SCSF is good documented in several blogs, I'm not aware of a good overview on the general part of Composite Apps, especially when it comes to typical pitfalls of such architectures and how to avoid them.

I believe that a lot of the problems related to such architectures are reoccuring (like patterns).  At least I've seen them on the last three apps I worked on. Bottomline: I thought it might be a good idea to share my current view on the topic and discuss it in further posts.

Stuff I'm planing to cover:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.bjoernrochel.de/2009/05/04/what-is-actually-a-composite-application/" target="_blank">What is actually a Composite App?</a></li>
	<li>When should you invest in a composite architecture?</li>
	<li>Typical pitfall: Assembly explosion</li>
	<li>Typical pitfall: The composite monolith aka broken module autonomy
(This will probably be more than just one post)</li>
	<li>Typical pitfall: Nontransparent remote calls</li>
	<li>Typical pitfall: Synchronous communication</li>
</ul>
The index of content is work in progress and I don't consider it to be complete. Feel free to post any suggestions and feedback . . .

Stay tuned for more !
