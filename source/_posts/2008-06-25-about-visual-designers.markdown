Today I came across a very interesting post from jeremy miller regarding
[his view on visual
designers](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2008/06/24/does-our-addiction-on-visual-tooling-harm-the-rate-of-innovation-in-the-net-world.aspx).
Everyone who works or worked with me so far knows I don't like visual
designers at all, which is quite funny since I was involved in building
a designer app for winforms and web-based forms for my company for the
bigger part of the last two years. To link my experience to the article:
Imho it's very expensive and difficult to create a designer app with a
very good user experience. Enjoy it!
