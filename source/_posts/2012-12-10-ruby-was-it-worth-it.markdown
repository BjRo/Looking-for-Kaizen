It's always healthy to look closely into the mirror from time to time, to check up on how your expectations hold up to reality. If you've been following me one way or the other over the last years, you probably know that I [changed quite a bit in the last 12 months](/2012/11/15/at-the-crossroads/). With the year nearing closure it's probably a good time to pause for thought. A good time for a retrospective of the months that lie behind me.

Yesterday my team finally released one of the products we've been working on this year, the [XING developer portal](http://dev.xing.com). We managed to do that in time, without features cut, without notable extra work hours and most important without notable defects.
