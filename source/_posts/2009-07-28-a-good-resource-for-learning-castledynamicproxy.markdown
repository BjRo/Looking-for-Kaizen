Castle.DynamicProxy is one of those really cool libraries with really
poor documentation. Today I stumbled over Krysztof Kozmics blog, which
has a really, really good tutorial for Castle.DynamicProxy. 

The tutorial covers most of its features. If you're interested, give it a try. You
won't regret it . . .
