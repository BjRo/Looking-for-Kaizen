What's the importance of <em>Should </em>in BDD? Why isn't it called <em>Must</em>, <em>Need to</em> or <em>Will</em>?  It's one of those subtle psychological things . . .

The main reason Dan North decided to use <em>Should </em>instead of all other  possibilities is, that <em>Should </em>implies that you can always question the behavior of your system. It isn't written in stone. If you think the system doesn't behave correctly any more, feel free to change or drop the particular spec.

I found this little comment of Dan North worth remembering . . .
