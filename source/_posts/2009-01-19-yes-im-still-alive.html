<p>First of all: Happy new year to everyone. I know, I know, I'm really late with that :-)</p>  <p>It's been really quite on this blog for the last two month and I'm sorry for that. I've been busy changing a lot of things that caused me frustration and friction in my life as a software engineer in 2008 ... </p>  <p>Anyway, 2009, a new year. What's to expect from this blog this year?    <br /></p>  <ol>   <li><strong>Ruby</strong>      <br />      <br />Following the pragmatic programmers advice I started to learn a new language, namely Ruby. Expect to see a lot of posts around the Ruby language, the Rake buildsystem, Gems, RSpec, Ruby on Rails and IronRuby in the future.      <br /></li>    <li><strong>Software architecture in .NET and the Ruby realm</strong>      <br />      <br />A good, simple software design has always been one of the key aspects to successful software projects for me. This includes testability, automation, convention-based development, reversibility, extensibility, maintainability and a lot of other stuff.&#160; Many areas to be covered. Lots of posts to be written :-)</li> </ol>  <p>Stay tuned for more . . .   </p>
