Because of several requests I uploaded the little BDD extension I
recently wrote for xunit. It's basically a port of the framework JP
Boodhoos currently uses in his famous Nothing but .Net bootcamps (he's
using MbUnit). So
[here](http://www.bjoernrochel.de/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/xunitbddextensions.zip)
it is. Any feedback is appreciated . . .
