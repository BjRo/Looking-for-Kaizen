Today I would like to conclude my little series about the Notification Pattern with (I guess at least for some of you) the most interesting part: <strong>Today is all about displaying Notifications in the UI</strong>. This post will guide you through all the steps I took in order to achieve the affect I demonstrated in the <a href="http://www.bjoernrochel.de/2009/10/20/notifications-the-wpf-way-i-guess-part-i/" target="_blank">introduction post</a>.

Last time I showed how I'm transfering Notifications from the ViewModel into the logical WPF tree. If you've not read the previous posts, please give them some minutes, because I'm not going to repeat a lot of them today. You can find them <a href="http://www.bjoernrochel.de/2009/08/28/implementing-the-notification-pattern-using-dataannotation-validators/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.bjoernrochel.de/2009/10/20/notifications-the-wpf-way-i-guess-part-i/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.bjoernrochel.de/2009/10/27/notifications-the-wpf-way-i-guess-part-ii/">here</a>.

As always, a quick reminder: <em>What I'm showing is in this series is <strong>how I've implemented the Notification Pattern</strong>. I'm not claiming that it's the only or the best way to do so. However, it's the one that works very good for me.
</em>

<strong><font size="4">How to get the red border effect</font></strong>

The red border has to be displayed when Notifications exists for a control. Technically this means
that the attached property "Notifications" (which is defined on the ValidationBehavior class I showed in the last post) is set to a non empty NotificationCollection.

We can react to this by defining a DataTrigger for this. In my own words I would describe DataTriggers as

<em>An in XAML defined event handler with a related criteria. When the criteria is matched the DataTrigger gets executed. When it isn't matched any more, the DataTrigger reverts the state of the element on which it's defined to the state before it was executed.</em>

Sounds usable for our purpose. Think about it, we only want to show the red border, when the attached property is set to a non empty collection. If the property is reset the border needs to disappear.

The only difficulty with DataTriggers we need to solve on our way is how to configure that exactly in XAML. DataTriggers can be easily set on primitives (such as string, bool, etc.) or null, but there isn't an out of the box way for setting our criteria in XAML.

However you can use a custom Converter for converting our value to a primitive "switch".

[sourcecode language="csharp"]

    [ValueConversion(typeof(NotificationCollection), typeof(bool))]
    public class ContainsNotificationConverter : IValueConverter
    {
        public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)
        {
            return (value != null &amp;&amp; value is NotificationCollection &amp;&amp; ((NotificationCollection)value).Any());
        }

        public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)
        {
            throw new NotSupportedException();
        }
    }

[/sourcecode]


Using this converter we can define our DataTrigger in the Style for Controls like this:

[sourcecode language="xml"]

   <Fx:ContainsNotificationConverter x:Key="notificationConverter" />

   <Style TargetType="Control">
        <Setter Property="Fx:ValidationBehavior.IsEnabled" Value="true" />
        <Style.Triggers>
            <DataTrigger 
                Binding="{Binding Path=(Fx:ValidationBehavior.Notifications), 
                Converter={StaticResource notificationConverter}, 
                RelativeSource={x:Static RelativeSource.Self}}" Value="true">
                <Setter Property="BorderBrush" Value="Red" />
                <Setter Property="BorderThickness" Value="2" />
            </DataTrigger>
        </Style.Triggers>
    </Style>
[/sourcecode]

<p><b><font size="4">How to display Notifications in a Tooltip</font></b></p>

Solving the Tooltip requirement was a bit more tricky (at least for me). It took me quite some time to figure out how to do this in WPF. The solution I'm going to show uses only XAML based code. 

<p><b>1. Integrating the Tooltip into the DataTrigger</b></p>

We simply use our DataTrigger to automatically set theTooltip of a Control in case Notifications exist. 

[sourcecode language="xml"]

   <ToolTip x:Key="ValidationErrorTooltip" />

   <Style TargetType="Control">
        <Setter Property="Fx:ValidationBehavior.IsEnabled" Value="true" />
        <Style.Triggers>
            <DataTrigger 
                Binding="{Binding Path=(Fx:ValidationBehavior.Notifications), 
                Converter={StaticResource notificationConverter}, 
                RelativeSource={x:Static RelativeSource.Self}}" Value="true">
                <Setter Property="BorderBrush" Value="Red" />
                <Setter Property="BorderThickness" Value="2" />
                <Setter Property="ToolTip" Value="{StaticResource ValidationErrorTooltip}" />
            </DataTrigger>
        </Style.Triggers>
    </Style>
[/sourcecode]

Now the UI looks really crappy. The tooltip is not recognizable as one.

<p><b>2. Using a ControlTemplate to style the Tooltip</b></p>

In order to shape the appearance of the Tooltip we can use Styles again. You can change the whole visual appearance of a Control using Styles and ControlTemplates. The template I defined consists mostly of a DockPanel containing a Label (which provides the tooltips caption) and a TextBlock (which will later contain the Notification messages).

[sourcecode language="xml"]

    <Style x:Key="ErrorTooltipSyle" TargetType="ToolTip">
        <Setter Property="Template">
            <Setter.Value>
                <ControlTemplate TargetType="ToolTip">
                    <Border BorderBrush="Black" BorderThickness="1">
                        <DockPanel>
                            <Label DockPanel.Dock="Top"
                            	FontWeight="Bold" 
                            	Background="Red" 
                            	Foreground="White"
                            	Content="Validation Error" />
                            <TextBlock 
                            	Padding="10" 
                            	Background="White" 
                            	Foreground="Black"
                            	TextWrapping="WrapWithOverflow" />
                        </DockPanel>
                    </Border>
                </ControlTemplate>
            </Setter.Value>
        </Setter>
    </Style>

    <!-- Notice the defined Style -->
    <ToolTip x:Key="ValidationErrorTooltip" Style="{StaticResource ErrorTooltipSyle}" />
    
    <Style TargetType="Control">
        <Setter Property="Fx:ValidationBehavior.IsEnabled" Value="true" />
        <Style.Triggers>
            <DataTrigger 
                Binding="{Binding Path=(Fx:ValidationBehavior.Notifications), 
                Converter={StaticResource notificationConverter}, 
                RelativeSource={x:Static RelativeSource.Self}}" Value="true">
                <Setter Property="BorderBrush" Value="Red" />
                <Setter Property="BorderThickness" Value="2" />
                <Setter Property="ToolTip" Value="{StaticResource ValidationErrorTooltip}" />
            </DataTrigger>
        </Style.Triggers>
    </Style>

[/sourcecode]

Our UI now looks like this. 

<img src="http://www.bjoernrochel.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/signup_tooltipwithcontroltemplate1.jpg" alt="Tooltip with ItemSource" width="411" height="198" class="size-full wp-image-597" />

Not as crappy as before but we're not finished yet, because we're not displaying Notifications yet.

<p><b>3. Define Databinding on the Tooltip</b></p>

Defining the Databinding was probably the hardest step I had to take. The problem is that you need to get the NotificationCollection from the Control the ToolTip is displayed on. Being not a WPF pro figuring out how to do this took quite some time. Anyway, in order to get the Notification there isn't much you need to do.

The trick is to bind against the property PlacementTarget on the ToolTip class itself. This property holds the reference to the Control on which the Tooltip is displayed. All we need to do is to add a Binding to the Style definition that sets the DataContext of the ToolTip to the related control.

[sourcecode language="xml"]

    <Style x:Key="ErrorTooltipSyle" TargetType="ToolTip">
        ...
        <Setter Property="DataContext" Value="{Binding Path=PlacementTarget, RelativeSource={x:Static RelativeSource.Self}}" />
        ...
    </Style>

[/sourcecode]

The next step we need to take is setting up the Binding for our attached property "Notifications". Because a NotificationCollection can contain more than one Notification I used the ItemsControl for displaying them in the content area of the ToolTip.

[sourcecode language="xml"]

    <Style x:Key="ErrorTooltipSyle" TargetType="ToolTip">
      <Setter Property="DataContext" Value="{Binding Path=PlacementTarget, RelativeSource={x:Static RelativeSource.Self}}" />
        <Setter Property="Template">
            <Setter.Value>
                <ControlTemplate TargetType="ToolTip">
                    <Border BorderBrush="Black" BorderThickness="1">
                        <DockPanel>
                            <Label DockPanel.Dock="Top"
                            	FontWeight="Bold" 
                            	Background="Red" 
                            	Foreground="White"
                            	Content="Validation Error" />
                            <TextBlock 
                            	Padding="10" 
                            	Background="White" 
                            	Foreground="Black"
                            	TextWrapping="WrapWithOverflow">

                                <!-- This control displays our Notifications -->
                                <ItemsControl x:Name="notifications"
                                    HorizontalAlignment="Stretch"   
                                    Margin="10" 
                                    VerticalAlignment="Center"
                                    ItemsSource="{Binding Path=(Fx:ValidationBehavior.Notifications), Mode=OneWay}"/>

                             </TextBlock>
                        </DockPanel>
                    </Border>
                </ControlTemplate>
            </Setter.Value>
        </Setter>
    </Style>

[/sourcecode]

Voila, our Notifications are finally displayed in the UI.

<img src="http://www.bjoernrochel.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/signup_tooltipwithcontroltemplate2.jpg" alt="Tooltip with ControlTemplate" width="500" height="227" class="size-full wp-image-598" />

<p><b>4. Styling the Notifications</b></p>

In my initial post I showed a hyphen in front of each Notification. This is fairly easy to add, too. All you have to do is to define a DataTemplate for the Notification class and set it as the ItemTemplate of the ItemsControl we're using.  

[sourcecode language="xml"]

    <!-- Very simple data template -->
    <DataTemplate x:Key="NotificationTemplate">
        <StackPanel Orientation="Horizontal">
            <TextBlock>-</TextBlock>
            <TextBlock x:Name="notification" Text="{Binding}" />
        </StackPanel>
    </DataTemplate>

    <Style x:Key="ErrorTooltipSyle" TargetType="ToolTip">
      <Setter Property="DataContext" Value="{Binding Path=PlacementTarget, RelativeSource={x:Static RelativeSource.Self}}" />
        <Setter Property="Template">
            <Setter.Value>
                <ControlTemplate TargetType="ToolTip">
                    <Border BorderBrush="Black" BorderThickness="1">
                        <DockPanel>
                            <Label DockPanel.Dock="Top"
                            	FontWeight="Bold" 
                            	Background="Red" 
                            	Foreground="White"
                            	Content="Validation Error" />
                            <TextBlock 
                            	Padding="10" 
                            	Background="White" 
                            	Foreground="Black"
                            	TextWrapping="WrapWithOverflow">
                      		<ItemsControl x:Name="notifications"
                                    HorizontalAlignment="Stretch"   
                                    Margin="10" 
                                    VerticalAlignment="Center"
                                    ItemsSource="{Binding Path=(Fx:ValidationBehavior.Notifications), Mode=OneWay}"

                                    <!-- This uses configures our template for Notifications -->
                                    ItemTemplate="{StaticResource NotificationTemplate}" />

		                </TextBlock>
                        </DockPanel>
                    </Border>
                </ControlTemplate>
            </Setter.Value>
        </Setter>
    </Style>

[/sourcecode]

DataTemplates are also the weapon of choice if you want to display errors in a different fashion than warnings (for instance by displaying a different icon). This is where we arrived.

<img src="http://www.bjoernrochel.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/signup_tooltipfinishedjpg.jpg" alt="Tooltip finished" width="493" height="218" class="size-full wp-image-599" />

<p><b><font size="4">Closing thoughts</font></b></p>

What I like about the current solution is that it demonstrates in a nice way how different the programming model of WPF actually is compared to WinForms. The only imperative code we have is the code that transfers Notifications from our ViewModel into the logical tree. That's it. The rest, the complete visual appeal of the Notifications, is a separated concern. Those two things can be changed independently from each other, even by different roles in a development team (Designer/Developer). Besides that I like the way the composition based WPF model helps my application code to stay focused and clean with only minimum implementation constraints on the ViewModel itself (the INotificationSource interface). 

There're certainly things to improve both in XAML and in the glue code but I consider it a good start to build on.

In case you're interested in the complete code, I've uploaded it to a corner of the xUnit.BDDExtensions trunk. You can find it <a href="http://xunitbddextensions.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Experiments/WPF/Notifications/"> here </a>. Feel free to do whatever you want with the code . . .
