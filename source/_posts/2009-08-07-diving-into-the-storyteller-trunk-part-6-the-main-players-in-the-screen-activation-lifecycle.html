<p>
It has been an interesting time with the StoryTeller codebase so far. I've learned a lot about advanced StructureMap usage by scanning through the code, trying to understand the unit tests, debugging StoryTeller and writing some smaller programs based on the newly discovered patterns &amp; features.

However, my initial motivation for spending time with that codebase wasn't StructureMap or the Convention over Configuration topic but rather StoryTellers implementation of the screen activation lifecycle. Jeremy wrote bits about it in his "Build your Own Cab" series, but they where rather abstract and didn't show a lot of code. Many responsibilities he described seemed totally logical to me, but I had trouble putting all those concepts together into code (which mostly undermines that I only understood have of the stuff I read ;-)).

Things became really interesting again when Jeremy showed more parts at the Presentation Patterns talk at last NDC. Damn, I wasn't aware that a lot of the patterns he described were already implemented in the StoryTeller codebase (or did they emerge after the recent rewrite ???). With part 6 of my Story Teller journey I would like to spend some time describing the general players in the screen activation lifecycle. This will be a no-code-post. A high level view so to say.

<span style="underline;"><strong>ScreenCollection</strong></span>

In his Presentation Patterns talk Jeremy described that the kind of desktop application he worked on in the past implemented mostly one of two major navigation styles: Tab-style navigation or Web-style-navigation..
<ul>
	<li>Tab-style-navigation more or less means that every new screen or control is displayed on a different tab, a new content control in the UI.</li>
	<li>Web-style-navigation means that every new screen or control is mostly displayed in the same content control and replaces the previously displayed control. Basically a way how a browser handles things (of course, in the old ages before the empire, hm I mean tab ;-)).</li>
</ul>
StoryTeller implements a Tab-style navigation. However you don't interact with a TabControl directly in StoryTeller . It is exposed via the IScreenCollection interface. The functionality of this interface is mostly similar to CAL/CAG/PRISMs IRegion or the old IWorkspace interface in CAB. However there's a huge difference in what the IScreenCollection accepts in his Open, Close or Activate methods. They don't accept UserControls or UIElements, they accept only instances implementing the IScreen interface.

<span style="underline;"><strong>Screen</strong></span>

The complete screen activation lifecycle in StoryTeller is based on the IScreen interface and therefore completely decoupled from the related UI technology. Testability, baby !!!

The screen interface is mostly implemented directly by Presenters or ViewModels and exposes methods for determining current caption for the screen, or the activation and deactivation of commands. Screens are created by a ScreenSubject.

<strong><span style="underline;">ScreenSubject</span></strong>

ScreenSubject is a really nice abstraction which deals with the creation and the identification of a particular screen. This abstraction is really valuable in applications which behave a lot like Visual Studio when opening code files. Think about it, when you first open up a source code file by double clicking it in the Source Code Explorer a new tab or window is created for it. Double clicking the file again doesn't open a new window but rather activates the related tab or window. That's exactly what the ScreenSubject abstraction tries to achieve, too.

Freeing the consumer code from the decision whether to create a new screen or to activate an already existing screen is the responsibility of the ScreenSubject implementations.

<strong><span style="underline;">ShellConductor</span></strong>

The ShellConductor is THE BIG PLAYER in the screen activation lifecycle. In Martin Fowlers terms the ShellConductor fulfills the role of the ApplicationController. The ShellConductor is the piece of code that (besides some other topics) controls and coordinates the whole Screen handling.

He is responsible for screen activation and deactivation, controls the closing of Screens and acts as kind of a facade for typical application code working with the framework. You could say that the ScreenConductor is an ApplicationController broken down into more smaller, specialized parts.

As you can imagine the ShellConductor knows a lot of his buddies in the neighborhood. Just to give you an impression how a typical operation on the ShellConductor might look like, I'd like to walk you through the simple topic of opening a screen in the UI. Here are the Steps:
<ol>
	<li>Client code calls OpenScreen(new MyScreenSubject()) on the ShellConductor.</li>
	<li>ShellConductor knows the ScreenCollection and tries to find a Screen matching the subject in the collection.</li>
	<li>If a Screen was found, it's activated.</li>
	<li>If no Screen was found, the ShellConductor
<ol>
	<li>creates the target screen via the supplied ScreenSubject,</li>
	<li>adds it to the ScreenCollection and</li>
	<li>activates it in the ScreenCollection.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
The ShellConductor will be a larger topic I'm going to look into in one of the next posts, so please forgive me for the moment if I continue my overview with the last element for today, the Shell.

<span style="underline;"><strong>Shell</strong></span>

The Shell is the host window for the application. It's the frame in which the ScreenCollection and Screens are displayed. It's actually pretty dumb, since it only has kind of a container functionality.

<strong><span style="underline;">What I didn't touch today</span></strong>

To be honest there is a more in the StoryTeller UI layer than the stuff I described today. On of the major topics for instance I left out for the moment is the whole topic dealing with Commands, CommandBindings and InputGestures.

StoryTeller shows a nice way of how to use a little internal Dsl for defining Commands on the fly. So far I've looked at it only sufficiently but it looks really promising. I'm definitely going to spend a post or two for that topic, so stay tuned.

See you next time when it's time to look at some code again . . .
