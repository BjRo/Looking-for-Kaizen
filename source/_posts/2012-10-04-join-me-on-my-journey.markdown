In the last couple of months I've been reading, listening to and watching everything I could find or buy about REST and Hypermedia. I think I've now come to a point where the only logical continuation of this learning process is to try to apply what I've learned so far to an actual problem space. I really, really badly want to see a 'real world' example of those concepts in play. I want to experience the impact of such a design first hand, both  on the server and on the client side as well. 

You might ask yourself what my motivation behind all this is and I promise you, I will elaborate on that in detail, but not in this post. For the moment let's just say, I currently tend to think Hypermedia would make parts of my professional life a lot easier.

So here's what I would like to do: 

- I'm going to try to design a Hypermedia API for a social network from scratch. This will include the whole state machine / sitemap design for a small subset of the typical features of a social network.
- I will document the whole process of evaluating existing media types vs. the creation of a new vendor specific one for the API.
- I'm going to implement the API iteratively, starting with an MVP and then adding more and more features as we go along, documenting every step on the way here on this blog. I'm probably using Ruby on Rails for the server side part.
- I will throw in some nasty real world requirements I've encountered first hand while working on one of the larger HTTP APIs available in Germany.
- Last but not least, I want to also explore what Hypermedia means for the client side and this both in a statically and in a dynamically typed language. I'm probably going to use C# and Ruby for this.

Please note the following: I don't consider myself an expert on this topic. This is a learning exercise for me as well. Nevertheless, I thought to myself, if I'm doing this, I might as well do it publicly.
