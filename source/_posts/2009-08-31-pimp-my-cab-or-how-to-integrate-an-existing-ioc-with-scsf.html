A LITTLE WARNING: This post goes pretty deep into the CAB framework without examining the CAB basics. If you're unfamiliar with CAB or SCSF this post is probably not going to be very handy for you . . . 

My current project uses the Smart Client Software Factory which is build on top of the Composite UI Application Block from Microsofts Patterns &amp; Practices department. SCSF is an organizational standard at my current client and we're reusing some components of earlier projects (Large Parts of the Shell, Changetracking model etc.)

CAB is build around a very simple Dependency Injection machinery called the ObjectBuilder. I consider having the ObjectBuilder a good thing, compared to having no Dependency Injection at all. However if you've ever worked with any other IoC be it StructureMap, Unity, Windsor, NInject or some other container, you'll recognize pretty fast some limitations.

Its dependency injection mechanism

<ul type="square">
  <li>can't really be used without attributes.</li>
  <li>doesn't separate registration and creation very well, which often leads to ordering problems.</li>
  <li>can't close open generic types. If you've ever used generic specialization you're going to miss this.</li>
  <li>is pretty tightly coupled to the concept of WorkItems inside CAB.</li>
</ul>

The last point is actually the real pain point for me. The whole WorkItem API is way to general purpose and generic (meaning string based!!!) in many parts and actually not the kind of concept I would like to be a central piece of my application design. It's not intuitive to work with it and imho doesn't fall into the pit of success at all. Interestingly when you compare PRISM (which was also build by P&amp;P about two years later) to CAB you're going to recognize that the concept of WorkItems is completely missing in PRISM. Maybe I'm not the only one who feels that way. 

Our team decided very early that the whole contact area of our application to the CAB framework should be limited to the presentation layer. We wanted to use a fully fledged IoC on the lower layers. This lead to an intersting challenge: How to integrate those two pipelines? 

My initial thought was to replace the CreationStrategy used in CABs Builder class with something that reaches into our main container. This turned out not to be the best choice since a lot of CABs internal structure kind of relates to the standard behavior. I got something working for about half of the use cases, but it didn't really feel good.

You know the best ideas come up when you stand under the shower. At least this happened yesterday. Actually integrating those two things is pretty straight forward. I just needed to approach the problem differently.

CAB is build around attributes. A typical CAB service might look like this.

[sourcecode language="csharp"]

public class NavigationService 
{
    public NavigationService([ServiceDependency] IShell shell)
    {

    }
}

[/sourcecode]

The ServiceDependencyAttribute tells the ObjectBuilder that it should get the dependency from the collection of Services associated with the related WorkItem used to create the class. The interesting part is that this isn't a marker attribute. It's a fully fledged extension point to which the ObjectBuilder delegates the essential work of resolving an instance. 

<p><b>Here's the deal: You can write a custom tailored attribute which is called by the ObjectBuilder but uses you main IoC in order to resolve the dependency</b></p>

The implementation of this is actually pretty easy. Here are the steps you need to implement.

<p><b>1. Create a Static Gateway into your container</b></p>

Attributes are by their nature kind of static and created by the framework. In order to be able to call into my container from an attribute I created a static class which holds a reference to my container (You can of course also use the P&amp;P CommonServiceLocator for this). 

[sourcecode language="csharp"]

public static class Container
{
    private static IContainer _container;

    public static void SetContainer(IContainer container)
    {
        _container = container;
    }

    public static void object Resolve(Type type)
    {
        return _container.Resolve(type);
    }
}
[/sourcecode]

<p><b>2. Create an attribute deriving from ParameterAttribute</b></p>

The responsibility of ParameterAttributes in the ObjectBuilder is pretty limited. All they have to do is to create an implementation of the IParameter interface which will than be used to do the actual resolving. If you're wondering what the membertype is, that's the type of the parameter marked with the attribute (in the example code above this would be IShell). The CreateParameter method will automatically be called by the ObjectBuilder during the creation process.

[sourcecode language="csharp"]

public class ContainerDependencyAttribute : ParameterAttribute
{
   public override IParameter CreateParameter(Type memberType)
   {
       return new ContainerParameter(memberType);
   }
}

[/sourcecode]

<p><b>3. Create an implementation of IParameter which calls into your Static Gateway</b></p>

The IParameter interface defines two methods GetParameterType and GetValue. 

[sourcecode language="csharp"]

public interface IParameter
{
    public Type GetParameterType(IBuilderContext buildContext);
    object Getvalue(IBuilderContext buildContext);
}

[/sourcecode]

We simply implement the first one with returning the member type and the the second one with a call into our Gateway.

[sourcecode language="csharp"]

public class ContainerParameter : IParameter
{
   private Type _typeToResolve;

   public ContainerParameter(Type typeToResolve)
   {
      _typeToResolve = typeToResolve;
   }
  
   public Type GetParameterType(IBuilderContext buildContext)
   {
       return _typeToResolve;
   }
    
   public object Getvalue(IBuilderContext buildContext)
   {
       return Container.Resolve(_typeToResolve);
   }
}

[/sourcecode]

<p><b>Here is an example how it is used</b></p>

[sourcecode language="csharp"]

public class SomePresenter
{
    public SomePresenter(
         [ServiceDependency] INavigationService navigationService,
         [ContainerDependency] ISomeService someService)
    {
    }
}

[/sourcecode]

At least for us, this works like a charm. What I like about the solution is that it plays nicely by the rules of the CAB framework and doesn't fight the framework design, but still enables us to use the framework in a way we want to use it. 

The interesting aspect in this approach is that you're now able to haved mixed dependencies where one part is resolved using the surrounding CAB WorkItem and the other part is resolved using your container of choice. The whole attribute usage is limited to the presentation layer while the rest of the application can take advantage of fully fledged dependency injection without attribute, with generic specicialization and dynamic proxy generation, just to name a few options.
