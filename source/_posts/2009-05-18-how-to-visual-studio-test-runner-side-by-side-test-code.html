<p>After spending a lot of time with xUnit.net I recently had to go back to MSTest for my testing again (because it's the de facto standard at my current client which is not negotiable ;-(). 
</p>
Former colleagues of mine will probably laugh about this, because I've had a love-and-hate-relationship with MSTest and especially the VisualStudio runner in the past. I won't go into details here, but you can read about it <a href="http://www.bjoernrochel.de/tag/mstest/">here</a>. However since I currently have no other option I use what is there. Better writing tests such an environment, than writing no test at all. At least if you ask me.
<p />
This brings me back to the topic of the post. Some prerequisites: I like developing software in a TDD manner and am using Resharper with its 'Generate' and 'Move To' features a lot. I like the idea of having test-code side by side with the actual tested code. With this a lot of you're daily TDD life becomes at least a bit easier and painless. I see at least two advantages in such an approach:
<ol>
	<li>You don't have to copy generated classes from the test-assembly to the regular assembly.</li>
<li>You don't have to maintain two different folder hierarchies (The one in the code-assembly and the one in the regular assembly) and therefore know exactly where to look for test-code.
</li>
</ol>
<p />
This is one of the things I learned from JP Boodhoo in his NBDN bootcamp,  credit for the general idea goes to him for this. So how can we achieve this in VisualStudio with MSTest? 
<p />
DISCLAIMER: The stuff I describe in the rest of the post has to do with modifying the .csproj 'â€œ msbuild file of a project. If this is a 'no go' for you, you can probably stop reading here ;-). For the rest here is the list of steps I took in order to make it work:
<p>
<strong>Step 1: Add the ProjectType Guids to your project.</strong>
<p />
VisualStudio's test explorer scans only projects which are of a certain project type (aka the test project) for tests. VS identifies such a project based on the value of a particular node in the .csproj file, the <em>ProjectTypeGuid</em> node. Simply copy this one from an actual test project to the .csproj of your regular assembly. Another option of course would be to start with a test project from scratch. 
[sourcecode language="xml"]
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Project ToolsVersion="3.5" DefaultTargets="Build" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <Configuration Condition=" '$(Configuration)' == '' ">Debug</Configuration>
    <Platform Condition=" '$(Platform)' == '' ">AnyCPU</Platform>
    <ProductVersion>9.0.30729</ProductVersion>
    <SchemaVersion>2.0</SchemaVersion>
    <!-- The line below has to be added to regular projects -->
    <ProjectTypeGuids>{3AC096D0-A1C2-E12C-1390-A8335801FDAB};{FAE04EC0-301F-11D3-BF4B-00C04F79EFBC}</ProjectTypeGuids>
    <ProjectGuid>{890DA3CA-999A-474E-BA87-05A834CAB7B8}</ProjectGuid>
    <OutputType>Library</OutputType>
    <AppDesignerFolder>Properties</AppDesignerFolder>
    <RootNamespace>SpecReport</RootNamespace>
    <AssemblyName>SpecReport</AssemblyName>
    <TargetFrameworkVersion>v3.5</TargetFrameworkVersion>
    <FileAlignment>512</FileAlignment>
  </PropertyGroup>
[/sourcecode]
<strong>Step 2: Apply conditional compilation for not including the test code when compiling in release mode</strong>
<p />
So, the tests sit right next to the tested code, right? We presumable don't want our tests to be deployed to production. We can achieve this in MSBuild fairly easy with conditional compilation and wildcards. 
[sourcecode language="xml"]
  <ItemGroup>
    <!-- The line below skips all files ending with 'Spec.cs' when compiling in a mode other than DEBUG -->
    <Compile Condition="'$(Configuration)' == 'Debug'" Include="**\*Specs.cs" />
    <Compile Include="IReportEngine.cs" />
    <Compile Include="IReportGenerator.cs" />
    <Compile Include="Notification.cs" />
    <Compile Include="NotificationCollection.cs" />
    <Compile Include="Properties\AssemblyInfo.cs" />
    <Compile Include="ReportEngine.cs" />
    <Compile Include="ReportEngineArgs.cs" />
  </ItemGroup>
[/sourcecode]

<strong>Step 3: Apply conditional compilation for not deploying the test-related assemblies when compiling in release mode
</strong>
<p />
In order to get rid of the test-specific assemblies for production deployment you can also apply conditionals to the assembly references of a project.
[sourcecode language="xml"]
<ItemGroup>
<Reference Condition="'$(Configuration)' == 'Debug'" Include="Microsoft.VisualStudio.QualityTools.UnitTestFramework, Version=9.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a, processorArchitecture=MSIL" />
    <Reference Condition="'$(Configuration)' == 'Debug'" Include="Rhino.Mocks, Version=3.5.0.1337, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=0b3305902db7183f, processorArchitecture=MSIL">
      <SpecificVersion>False</SpecificVersion>
      <HintPath>..\Externals\RhinoMocks35\Rhino.Mocks.dll</HintPath>
    </Reference>
    <Reference Include="System" />
    <Reference Include="System.Core">
      <RequiredTargetFramework>3.5</RequiredTargetFramework>
    </Reference>
    <Reference Include="System.Xml.Linq">
      <RequiredTargetFramework>3.5</RequiredTargetFramework>
    </Reference>
    <Reference Include="System.Data.DataSetExtensions">
      <RequiredTargetFramework>3.5</RequiredTargetFramework>
    </Reference>
    <Reference Include="System.Data" />
    <Reference Include="System.Xml" />
  </ItemGroup>
[/sourcecode]

<p>
Et voila: The approach described in this post seams to work fine. At least I'm not experiencing side effects since I've configured it that way ...
