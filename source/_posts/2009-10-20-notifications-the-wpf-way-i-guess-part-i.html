<p><b>Update 2.11.2009: I removed the DependencyObject and DependencyProperty references from the ViewModel. The solution works fine without them.</b></p>

This is the start of a small mini series about how I would currently approach the 'Notification Pattern' in a WPF application, using the default WPF practices and patterns. Think about it as a step by step guide for using DataBinding, Control-Templates, Styles, Resource-Inheritance, Converters and the Attached-Behavior-Pattern for displaying Notifications in the WPF-UI. (I guess most of this is also doable in Silverlight too, but I've never done anything with SL so I can't say for sure). I've also prepared a little bit of sample code for this topic which will be download-able soon.

<strong>First,Â  some cautious warnings</strong>

I'm by no means a WPF-expert. I'm still in the learning phase. So,Â  if there are more obvious or intuitive solutions to the problem, or I'm plain wrong about this,Â  feel free to comment. I'm sure there is A LOT room for improvement.

<strong>What I've left out intentionally</strong>

I tried to strip everything unnecessary for the scope of the post from the code. This includes for instance IoC, Convention over Configuration, Code-Contracts, Expression-based Databinding setup and some base class or extension refactorings. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely value those elements, but I wanted the example to be as easy as possible while being somewhat useful for a 'real world' application. The code might look a bit raw at at some edges because of this. So please keep that in mind before throwing with stones ;-)

<strong>Some other prerequesites</strong>

A while back I wrote a post about <a href="http://www.bjoernrochel.de/2009/08/28/implementing-the-notification-pattern-using-dataannotation-validators/">implementing the Notification-pattern using System.Componentmodel.DataAnnotations</a>. It demonstrates the implementation of a generic validator based on the DataAnnotation attributes. Besides that, <a href="http://www.bjoernrochel.de/2009/08/19/the-attached-behavior-pattern/">this</a> post about the Attached-Behavior-Pattern will also be useful for this mini-series. Please give them a short visit if you haven't read them yet.

<strong>The example scenario</strong>

The scenario I'm going to use for the example is a very simple sign up form. It contains two input fields for username / email and a 'sign-up' button. It looks like this.

<a href="http://www.bjoernrochel.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/signup.bmp"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-561" src="http://www.bjoernrochel.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/signup.bmp" alt="" /></a>

Rules associated with the fields are:

1. Username is required and must at least be 5 characters long.
2. Email is required and must contain a valid email address.

If any of the rules is broken, the related element should be visually highlighted . . .

<a href="http://www.bjoernrochel.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/signupadorner.bmp"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-562" src="http://www.bjoernrochel.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/signupadorner.bmp" alt="" /></a>

. . . and when you hover over the element you'll get a detailed description of the error from a tooltip.

<a href="http://www.bjoernrochel.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/signuptooltip.bmp"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-563" src="http://www.bjoernrochel.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/signuptooltip.bmp" alt="" /></a>

I'm using the PresentationModel / MVVM pattern for the UI since it seems to be the default UI pattern in WPF.

<strong>Did you notice it? </strong>

There is NO CODE in the View (Xaml and code behind) or the ViewModel which displays the Notifications.There's also no base class for View or ViewModel where the code might be. What's there on the other hand is only a collection of Notifications hanging of the ViewModel which is filled by the Validator. You might yourself now ask: Where is the damn glue code?

Yeah I know dumb question because I answered it mostly in the introduction of the post. The interesting thing is that it isn't a single location. As you will see the responsibilities for achieving the effect are separated between several components.

<strong>In the next posts we're going to take a look at </strong>
<ul>
	<li>how to use the Attached-Behavior-Pattern together with Styles and resource based inheritance in order to match the Notification (s) from the ViewModel to the related FrameworkElements in the logical WPF tree.</li>
	<li>how to use a DataTrigger on an Attached Properties in order to setup the Tooltip and showing the red border.</li>
	<li>how to bind the Tooltip correctly to the related Notification (s).</li>

I hope I made you at least a bit curious . . .
