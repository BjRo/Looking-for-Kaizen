.... Microsoft seems to move Dependency Injection as part of the general topic "application extensibillity" into the .NET Framework core. Have a look at the post of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/kcwalina/archive/2008/04/25/MEF.aspx" target="_blank">Krzysztof  Cwalina about the Managed Extensibillity Framework (MEF)</a>. Although the project has just started and is clearly at an early stage,  a first <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/mef" target="_blank">CTP</a> has already been published. I'm going to dig into the CTP soon,  mostly because of curiosity.  One of Microsofts technical evangelists (namely Jason Olson) has also published an arcticle showing <a href="http://http://www.managed-world.com/2008/07/04/BuildingAFluentInterfaceForMEF.aspx" target="_blank">how to build a small internal DSL on top of MEF</a>.

It will be interesting to see where Microsofts efforts in that area are leading to (especially when you consider that the core team is working on it) . . .
