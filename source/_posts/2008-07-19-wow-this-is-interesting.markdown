.... Microsoft seems to move Dependency Injection as part of the general
topic "application extensibillity" into the .NET Framework core. Have a
look at the post of [Krzysztof Cwalina about the Managed Extensibillity
Framework
(MEF)](http://blogs.msdn.com/kcwalina/archive/2008/04/25/MEF.aspx).
Although the project has just started and is clearly at an early stage,
a first [CTP](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/mef) has already been
published. I'm going to dig into the CTP soon, mostly because of
curiosity. One of Microsofts technical evangelists (namely Jason Olson)
has also published an arcticle showing [how to build a small internal
DSL on top of
MEF](http://http://www.managed-world.com/2008/07/04/BuildingAFluentInterfaceForMEF.aspx).
It will be interesting to see where Microsofts efforts in that area are
leading to (especially when you consider that the core team is working
on it) . . .
