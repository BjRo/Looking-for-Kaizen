First of all: Happy new year to everyone. I know, I know, I'm really
late with that :-)

It's been really quite on this blog for the last two month and I'm sorry
for that. I've been busy changing a lot of things that caused me
frustration and friction in my life as a software engineer in 2008 ...

Anyway, 2009, a new year. What's to expect from this blog this year? \

1.  **Ruby** \
     \
    Following the pragmatic programmers advice I started to learn a new
    language, namely Ruby. Expect to see a lot of posts around the Ruby
    language, the Rake buildsystem, Gems, RSpec, Ruby on Rails and
    IronRuby in the future. \
2.  **Software architecture in .NET and the Ruby realm** \
     \
    A good, simple software design has always been one of the key
    aspects to successful software projects for me. This includes
    testability, automation, convention-based development,
    reversibility, extensibility, maintainability and a lot of other
    stuff. Many areas to be covered. Lots of posts to be written :-)

Stay tuned for more . . .
