<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/sfeldman/archive/2009/01/29/factory-per-dto.aspx" target="_blank">This </a> post by Sean Feldman was kind of an eye opener to me. It introduced me to a feature of Rhino.Mocks I wasn't really aware of and helped to solve a problem I was never able to solve in a really satisfying way.
<p>
As you might know xUnit.BDDExtensions is using Rhino.Mocks behind the scenes, but hides a lot of the mechanics of the library. This was done in order to eliminate a lot of the ceremony in a specification, so that a writer of a specification could focus on its essence (Quote MASHUP from JP and Jeremy D. Miller :-) ).  However, especially when configuring and verifying behaviors Rhino.Mocks still shines through (with all its power).
</p>
So let's take a closer look at the problem I'm referring to. It has to do with specifications which observe indirect outputs. The following code is part of a little object-to-object-mapper I wrote some months ago. 

[sourcecode language="csharp"]
public class ExpressionBasedWriter<Target, PropertyType> : IWriteStrategy<Target>
{
	private readonly IExpressionHandler expressionHandler;
	private readonly MemberExpression memberExpression;

	public ExpressionBasedWriter(
		Expression<Func> memberSelector, 
		IExpressionHandler expressionHandler)
	{
		this.memberExpression = (MemberExpression) memberSelector.Body;
		this.expressionHandler = expressionHandler;
	}

        public void WriteTo(Target instance, object value)
	{
		expressionHandler.Handle(new HandlerContext
                {
                      TargetInstanceType = instance.GetType(),
                      TargetInstance = instance,
                      ValueToWrite = value,
                      MemberSelector = memberExpression
                });
	}
}
[/sourcecode]
<p>
It's not so important to understand the full context of the code. The important part is in the body of the WriteTo() method. Do you see it? It constructs an instance and passes it into an internal dependency. The interesting question now is how to verify the indirect output passed to the dependeny in a spec...
</p>
<strong>Take 1: Overriding Equals and GetHashcode() in the indirect output class.</strong>
<p>
In case you correctly implemented both of these methods you could write a spec, that looks like somewhat like this.
<p>
[sourcecode language="csharp"]
    [Concern(typeof(ExpressionBasedWriter<,>))]
    public class When_something_is_about_to_be_written : InstanceContextSpecification<IWriteStrategy<TestDto1>>
    {
        private IExpressionHandler expressionHandler;
        private Expression<Func> targetExpression;
        private TestDto1 target;
        private string valueToWrite;

        protected override void EstablishContext()
        {
            targetExpression = x => x.StringProperty;
            expressionHandler = Dependency();
            target = new TestDto1();
            valueToWrite = "uninteresting value";
        }

        protected override IWriteStrategy CreateSut()
        {
            return new ExpressionBasedWriter(targetExpression, expressionHandler);
        }

        protected override void Because()
        {
            Sut.WriteTo(target, valueToWrite);
        }

        [Observation]
        public void should_form_a_context_and_pass_it_to_the_actual_expression_handler()
        {
            expressionHandler.WasToldTo(x => x.Handle(new HandlerContext
            {
                MemberSelector = (MemberExpression)targetExpression.Body,
                TargetInstance = target,
                TargetInstanceType = target.GetType(),
                ValueToWrite = valueToWrite
            }));
        }
    }
[/sourcecode]

This works. Ok, but what I don't like about this solution is that I expose the concrete HandlerContext class to the spec. Test isolation is broken here. Besides I have to be very carefully with my implementation of Equals in this case, although it might only be needed in the specification.
</p>
<strong>Take 2: Introduce a factory</strong>
<p>
You can prevent the direct exposure of the specification to the concrete HandlerContext by introducing a factory which abstacts the creation of the HandlerContext class away.
</p>
[sourcecode language="csharp"]
	public class ExpressionBasedWriter<Target,PropertyType> : IWriteStrategy<PropertyType>
	{
		private readonly IExpressionHandler expressionHandler;
		private readonly IHandlerContextFactory handleContextFactory;
		private readonly MemberExpression memberExpression;

		public ExpressionBasedWriter(
			Expression<Func> memberSelector, 
			IExpressionHandler expressionHandler, 
			IHandlerContextFactory handleContextFactory)
		{
			this.memberExpression = (MemberExpression) memberSelector.Body;
			this.expressionHandler = expressionHandler;
			this.handleContextFactory = handleContextFactory;
		}

		public void WriteTo(Target instance, object value)
		{
			var context = handleContextFactory.CreateContext(memberExpression, instance, value);
			expressionHandler.Handle(context);
		}
	}

	[Concern(typeof (ExpressionBasedWriter<,>))]
	public class When_something_is_about_to_be_written :
		InstanceContextSpecification<IWriteStrateg<TestDto1>>
	{
		private IExpressionHandler expressionHandler;
		private IHandlerContext handlerContext;
		private IHandlerContextFactory handlerContextFactory;
		private TestDto1 target;
		private Expression<Func> targetExpression;
		private string valueToWrite;

		protected override void EstablishContext()
		{
			targetExpression =  x => x.StringProperty;
			expressionHandler = Dependency();
			handlerContextFactory = Dependency();
			handlerContext = Dependency();

			target = new TestDto1();
			valueToWrite = "uninteresting value";

			handlerContextFactory.WhenToldTo(x => x.CreateContext((MemberExpression)targetExpression.Body, target, valueToWrite)).Return(handlerContext);
		}

		protected override IWriteStrategy CreateSut()
		{
			return new ExpressionBasedWriter(targetExpression, expressionHandler, handlerContextFactory);
		}

		protected override void Because()
		{
			Sut.WriteTo(target, valueToWrite);
		}

		[Observation]
		public void should_call_the_context_handler_factory_in_order_to_create_a_context()
		{
			handlerContextFactory.WasToldTo(x => x.CreateContext((MemberExpression)targetExpression.Body, target, valueToWrite));
		}

		[Observation]
		public void should_call_the_expression_handler_in_order_to_handle_the_created_context()
		{
			expressionHandler.WasToldTo(x => x.Handle(handlerContext));
		}
	}

Again, this works too. But is that really a path one should go? Introducing an additional factory + interface everytime one encounters an indirect output? Besides that, did you notice how the specification kind of degraded? So much additional noise now in there. This one causes me actually more pain than Take 1, which takes me to ...
</p>
<strong>Take 3: A neat Rhino.Mocks feature</strong>
<p>
Leave the code from Take 1 as it is. Here's how you can write the specification, without exposing it to the concrete HandlerContext class and without causing to much noise in the specification itself.
</p>
[sourcecode language="csharp"]
    [Concern(typeof(ExpressionBasedWriter<,>))]
    public class When_something_is_about_to_be_written : InstanceContextSpecification<IWriteStrategy<TestDto1>>
    {
        private IExpressionHandler expressionHandler;
        Expression<Func> targetExpression;
        private TestDto1 target;
        private string valueToWrite;

        protected override void EstablishContext()
        {
            targetExpression = x => x.StringProperty;
            expressionHandler = Dependency();
            target = new TestDto1();
            valueToWrite = "uninteresting value";
        }

        protected override IWriteStrategy CreateSut()
        {
            return new ExpressionBasedWriter(targetExpression, expressionHandler);
        }

        protected override void Because()
        {
            Sut.WriteTo(target, valueToWrite);
        }

        [Observation]
        public void should_form_a_context_and_pass_it_to_the_actual_expression_handler()
        {
            	expressionHandler.WasToldTo(x => x.Handle(Arg<IHandlerContext>.Matches(matcher => 
                       matcher.MemberSelector == targetExpression.Body &&
                       matcher.TargetInstance == target &&
                       matcher.TargetInstanceType == target.GetType() &&
                       matcher.ValueToWrite.Equals(valueToWrite))));
        }
    }
[/sourcecode]

<p> 
The interesting stuff happens around the generic Arg class. You can use it to specify a callback with which the indirect output can be verified. 
</p>
<strong>Conclusion</strong>
<p>
In the past I mostly did what I demonstrated with Take 1 when I encountered a situation where I needed to verify indirect outputs. Introducing a factory for this was never really an option for me. I don't see a real benefit there. The generic argument matching capabilities of Rhino.Mocks really close a gap for me and they're what I'm going to use for solving similar situations from now on. </p><p> I hope I'm not the only kid on the street who didn't know that this feature exists . . . </p>
