<div style="0pt 3em 1.2em 0pt;">

xUnit.BDDExtensions is a little framework build on top of xUnit which enables a BDD style of testing with xUnit.

Besides an emphasis on a "test case class per fixture" organization scheme for tests, AAA (Arrange, Act and Assert) style of writing tests and left to right assertions, this framework also provides Rhino.Mocks integration out of the box. By hiding the mechanics of Rhino.Mocks (record and replay model, mocks vs. stubs)  behind the scenes, xUnit.BDDExtensions also helps on writing cleaner, easier to understand and less brittle tests

xUnit.BDDExtensions is based on JP Boodhoos BDD extensions for MBUnit used in his "Nothing but .NET" bootcamps.

<p><b>Enough of the talking, let's look at some code</b></p>

This is actual code of the xUnit.BDDExtensions trunk. The <em>SpecificationTestCommand </em>class serves as a kind of adapter inside xUnit. It enables the test class to have methods that are run before and after the actual test method is executed.* 

[sourcecode language="csharp"]
    public class SpecificationTestCommand : BeforeAfterCommand
    {
        public SpecificationTestCommand(
            ITestCommand innerCommand,
            MethodInfo testMethod)
            : base(innerCommand, testMethod)
        {
        }

        public override MethodResult Execute(object testClass)
        {
            var specification = testClass as ITestSpecification;

            try
            {

                if (specification == null)
                {
                    throw new InvalidOperationException(
                          "Instance does not implement ITestSpecification");
                }

                specification.InitializeSpecification();
                return base.Execute(testClass);
            }
            finally
            {
                if (specification != null)
                {
                    specification.CleanupSpecification();
                }
            }
        }
    }
[/sourcecode]

Notice several things: 

<ol>
	<li>It expects the instance to implement <em>ITestSpecification</em>.</li>
	<li>It calls the <em>InitializeSpecification()</em> method on it </li>
        <li>Passes the execution to the inner command (in <em>base.Execute(obj)</em>) </li>
	<li>and finally cleans up the specification by calling <em>CleanupSpecification() </em>on it.</li>
</ol>

So how can a completely isolated happy path test for this look like?

[sourcecode language="csharp"]
 [Concern(typeof(SpecificationTestCommand))]
 public class when_a_specification_test_command_is_executed_on_a_ITestSpecification_implementer :
        concern_for_specification_test_command
    {
        private MethodResult expectedTestResult;
        private ITestCommand innerCommand;
        private MethodInfo methodInfo;
        private MethodResult testResult;
        private ITestSpecification testSpecification;

        protected override void EstablishContext()
        {
            innerCommand = Dependency();
            testSpecification = Dependency();
            methodInfo = GetTestMethodHandle();
            expectedTestResult = CreateMethodResult(methodInfo);

            innerCommand.WhenToldTo(x => x.Execute(testSpecification))
                     .Return(expectedTestResult);
        }

        protected override SpecificationTestCommand CreateSut()
        {
            return new SpecificationTestCommand(innerCommand, methodInfo);
        }

        protected override void Because()
        {
            testResult = Sut.Execute(testSpecification);
        }

        [Observation]
        public void should_ask_the_test_specification_to_initialize()
        {
            testSpecification.WasToldTo(x => x.InitializeSpecification());
        }

        [Observation]
        public void should_pass_the_test_specification_to_the_inner_test_command()
        {
            innerCommand.WasToldTo(x => x.Execute(testSpecification));
        }

        [Observation]
        public void should_return_the_test_result_from_the_inner_test_command()
        {
            testResult.ShouldBeEqualTo(expectedTestResult);
        }

        [Observation]
        public void should_ask_the_test_specification_to_cleanup()
        {
            testSpecification.WasToldTo(x => x.CleanupSpecification());
        }
    }
[/sourcecode]

Notice several things:

<ol>
   <li>
       In the <em>EstablishContext()</em> method the whole context for the test is created.  This includes creating most of the dependencies with Rhino.Mocks through <em>Dependeny()</em> and the necessary configuration of their behavior. This is done in order to quickly get from an interaction based style of testing to a state based style of testing. In AAA terms this method implements the Arrange part.
   </li>
   <li> The <em>CreateSut()</em> method is executed after <em>EstablishContext()</em> and creates the actual system under test.</li>
   <li> The <em>Because()</em> method implements the actual behavior under test. In AAA terms this is the Act part. In the current example this meant executing the test command with an instance implementing the expected interface.</li>
   <li> Each method marked with the <em>ObservationAttribute</em> contains a single observation which should be fulfilled when the test has been executed. In AAA terms every Observation is an Assert.</li>
</ol>

That's basically it. Pretty straight forward imho. If I managed to make you at least a bit curious about this style of testing, you can grab the source with any Subversion client from:

<tt><strong><em>http</em></strong>://xunitbddextensions.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
</tt></div>

Enjoy coding

I know xUnit dropped this behavior in favor of the dispose pattern, but having explicit, non technically named methods for that still seems more natural in the context of BDD to me.
