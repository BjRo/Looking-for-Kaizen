After 1 1/2 hours of train ride , 11 hours of flight and 30 minutes with
a taxi (in that order) I finally arrived in San Francisco. It's my first
time in the USA and I'm also currently experiencing jet lag for the
first time. 9 hour time difference is huge! It's a weird feeling when
the clock says 14:30 and you're body expects it to be 23:30. \

Anyway, what a city !!! That's the look from my hotel window . . . \

QCon tutorials start on Monday morning. That leaves two and a half days
for exploring San Francisco. Excellent . . .
