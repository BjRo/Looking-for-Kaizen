Over the last weekend I participated in the first German Open Spaces
conference. The [**.NET Open Spaces**](http://www.netopenspace.de/) was
inspired by the recent ALT.NET conferences in London and Seattle. The
basic idea behind Open Spaces is that the attendees decide the actual
topics of the sessions. No separation between speakers, attendees and
the organizing team exits and every participant is responsible for
making the best of the conference. I was a bit skeptical at first
whether the whole concept of Open Spaces could be easily done in
Germany. It had been done with a lot of success several times all around
the globe before, but I somehow had the feeling that the whole concept
of self-organization doesn't really play out well in Germany with its
mostly full-organized conference formats. Looking back now, I've to
admit that I was **totally wrong about this**. I guess that relates to
the fact that I never participated in such a format in the past. Imho
the [**.NET Open Spaces**](http://www.netopenspace.de/) conference in
Leipzig was a huge success on all fronts. The last two days where filled
with lots of amazing conversations with passionate people from Germany,
Austria and Switzerland about software design, software architecture,
all the xDD stuff (MDSD, BDD, TDD, DDD, FDD), agile software
development, tooling, etc. To give you an idea about the content, here
are some of the sessions I was involved in during the conference.

-   **TDD and BDD** A fishbowl discussion about unit testing, TDD, BDD
    and the problem of how to introduce / integrate such concepts into a
    development team.
-   **xDD: Demystifying the buzzwords** A fishbowl discussion about xDD
    buzzwords which started with an introduction of each xDD concept and
    ended with a discussion about software quality. A bit unfocussed, so
    to say :-(
-   **NHibernate** A discussion about when and how to use NHibernate in
    .NET projects.
-   **Doing BDD with pair programming** Together with [Gabriel
    Schenker](http://blogs.hibernatingrhinos.com/nhibernate/Default.aspx)
    I did some live coding in order to demonstrate BDD and pair
    programming. Gabriel coded the specifications while I implemented
    them. I did this with JP Boodhoo several weeks ago at the .NET user
    group in Bonn. Luckily this time I wasn't so nervous. Seems that I'm
    getting accustomed to live coding in front of a large audience. :-)
-   **A detailed look at Model View Presenter** I gave a little talk
    about my experience with MVP which started with a short introduction
    of the Passive View and the Supervising Controller pattern, then
    introduced the variation of MVP which I currently favor (a variation
    of Passive View) and ended in a really nice discussion how others
    approach MVP.
-   **.NET Enterprise Architectures**An interesting session where
    several participants presented their current application
    architecture of choice for developing large scale enterprise
    applications. "What can we learn from Enterprise Java
    Architectures?" was also a very hot topic that day.
-   **The use of messaging in distributed and non-distributed
    applications** I gave a little introduction to the concepts
    implemented in the Aurora Application Framework. This is a framework
    for developing message based composite applications with .NET which
    is currently under development at ICW, my current employer.
-   **Several other smaller topics like**
    -   An introduction to xUnit.BDDExtensions
    -   A discussion about IoC-Containers
    -   How to introduce code reviews, guidelines etc. into the
        development process of a company.

Some final words: A big thank you to the people responsible for the
whole organization, namely [Alexander
Gro√ü](http://www.therightstuff.de/2008/10/16/NET-Open-Space-2008.aspx),
[Torsten Weber](http://blogs.compactframework.de/Torsten.Weber/) and
[Stefan Lieser](http://lieser-online.de/). You guys did an awesome job
making this event happen. Also a big thank you to all the other guys for
having such wonderful conversations and being so passionate about
software development.... The only sad thing is that I'll have to wait
for a year now until the next .NET Open Spaces conference (in Germany) .
