I'm very glad to announce that [Machine.Fakes](http://www.github.com/machine/machine.fakes) has found 
a new home. [Simon Hohenadl](http://github.com/simonhohenadl) and [Christian Deger](https://github.com/christiandeger) of 
[Autoscout 24](http://www.autoscout24.de/) have taken over as active maintainers. 

The last [nuget release](http://nuget.org/packages/Machine.Fakes) was already done without any involvement from myself.
I'm doing my best to help them getting up to speed with the internals, but I've high confidence
that they won't need much help to really grok it. 


Thank you all for your support!
