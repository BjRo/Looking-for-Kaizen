Hello back again on my little exploration of the UserInterface implementation of Jeremy Millers StoryTeller. I'd like to start today with a little excuse (oh my). Although I said last time that the current post would be focused on the ScreenConductor, I decided to delay that at least for one post in the series in order to add some content related to what Jeremy calls ScreenSubject and ScreenFactory. I consider them to be fairly simple but yet really powerful pattern which can help you a lot to structure your UI layer, especially the fine line of the UI layer where the UI infrastructure meets the common application code. It's also a very good example of applying the Open Closed Principle.

<p><b>The common use case for the ScreenSubject</b></p>

Lets first start with a little description of the usage of the two patterns in StoryTeller. When application code wants to open a new screen in StoryTeller it'll probably use one of the OpenScreen overloads on the IScreenConductor facade in order to do that.

[sourcecode language="csharp"]
public interface IScreenConductor
{
    void OpenScreen(IScreenSubject subject);
    void OpenScreen<T>() where T: IScreenSubject;	
}
[/sourcecode]

The common use case for the ScreenSubject can be easily depicted using a tool we all know quite well, Visual Studio. Think about it: What happens when you click onto a source code file in the Source Code Explorer for the first time? Well, a new tab is created displaying the content of the file. However, if you click the item in the Source Control Explorer the second time, the previously created tab gets activated and NO NEW TAB IS CREATED.

<p><b>How is this implemented</b></p>

Let's take a look at how this behavior is implemented in StoryTeller. The following code snippet shows a very small part of the ScreenConductor. I've inline some comments in order to make it more visible
what is going on there.

[sourcecode language="csharp"]

        public virtual void OpenScreen(IScreenSubject subject)
        {
            //_screens is of type IScreenCollection
            if (subject.Matches(_screens.Active))
            {
                return;
            }

            //This simply makes a LINQ-lookup on the ScreenCollection
            //using ScreenSubject.Matches as a predicate
            IScreen screen = findScreenMatchingSubject(subject);

            if (screen == null)
            {
                //This passes the global IScreenFactory into the
                //ScreenSubjects CreateScreen method in order to create
                //the screen.
                screen = createNewActiveScreen(subject);
            }
            else
            {
                activate(screen);
            }

            _screens.Show(screen);
        }

[/sourcecode]

The IScreenSubject abstraction plays a quite important role in this use case. The interface defines only two methods matching the responsibilities of the ScreenSubject

[sourcecode language="csharp"]

    public interface IScreenSubject
    {
        bool Matches(IScreen screen);
        IScreen CreateScreen(IScreenFactory factory);
    }

[/sourcecode]

As we saw in the ScreenConductor snippet the Matches method is used as a predicate in order to find the related screen. The CreateScreen method isn't directly shown in the snippet, but it's not that complicated. It's responsible for coordinating the creation of a screen. When I say coordination I'm referring to the fact that the actual screen creation is the responsibility of the IScreenFactory (which is just a simple wrapper around StructureMap).

[sourcecode language="csharp"]

   public interface IScreenFactory
    {
        T Build<T>() where T : IScreen;
        IScreen<T> Build<T>(T subject);
    }

[/sourcecode]

With this design in place we have a very nice extension point in place to do all kinds of things around the screen creation. Want to do some deferred data loading before the screen is shown? That's your place. Maybe you want to show some progress indicator while doing this. Guess what, that's your place to do this. And the best of it: The screen doesn't have to know anything of this, you can free
him of this kind of logic.

There're some base classes which provide some base implementation for different use cases in StoryTeller. I'm only going to show one of them, the ScreenSubject&lt;T&gt;. This class adds a bit generics on top of the ScreenSubject (in order to allow auto-registration using StructureMaps convention over configuration features). 

[sourcecode language="csharp"]

   // Marker interface
    public interface IScreenSubject<T> : IScreenSubject
    {
    }

    public class ScreenSubject<T> : IScreenSubject<T>
    {
        private readonly T _subject;

        public ScreenSubject(T subject)
        {
            _subject = subject;
        }

        #region IScreenSubject<T> Members

        public bool Matches(IScreen screen)
        {
            var specific = screen as IScreen<T>;
            if (specific == null) return false;

            return specific.Subject.Equals(_subject);
        }

        public IScreen CreateScreen(IScreenFactory factory)
        {
            return factory.Build(_subject);
        }

        #endregion

        public bool Equals(ScreenSubject<T> other)
        {
            if (ReferenceEquals(null, other)) return false;
            if (ReferenceEquals(this, other)) return true;
            return Equals(other._subject, _subject);
        }

        public override bool Equals(object obj)
        {
            if (ReferenceEquals(null, obj)) return false;
            if (ReferenceEquals(this, obj)) return true;
            if (obj.GetType() != typeof (ScreenSubject<T>)) return false;
            return Equals((ScreenSubject<T>) obj);
        }

        public override int GetHashCode()
        {
            return _subject.GetHashCode();
        }
    }

[/sourcecode]

The basic idea used in this implementation of IScreenSubject is that a ScreenSubject is related to a single data instance. Coming back to the Visual Studio example, this could have been represented as something like ScreenSubject&lt;SourceCodeFile&gt;. Really interesting . . .

The last code snippet for today I'd like to show is how the ScreenFactory is actually implemented. As usual really short, not very much code. 

[sourcecode language="csharp"]

    public class ScreenFactory : IScreenFactory
    {
        private readonly IContainer _container;

        public ScreenFactory(IContainer container)
        {
            _container = container;
        }

        #region IScreenFactory Members

        public SCREEN Build<SCREEN>() where SCREEN : IScreen
        {
            return _container.GetInstance<SCREEN>();
        }

        public IScreen<T> Build<T>(T subject)
        {
            return _container.With(subject).GetInstance<IScreen<T>>();
        }

        #endregion
    }
[/sourcecode]

I really like the way how StructureMap allows injecting transient parameters in the resolution process . . .

<p><b>Closing thoughts</b></p>

I'm honest with you. I consider ScreenSubject to be one of the most valuable patterns I've learned so far while playing with the StoryTeller sources. It provides such a nice extension point for screen initialization. I think it's one of those patterns you don't know how much you miss it until you see it for the first time and recognize how much it could have helped you in the past. At least that was my reaction. 

In the past I've put a lot of the functionality which resides in StoryTeller in ScreenSubject implementations on my screens which polluted my screens with a lot of initialization code and sometimes (especially when you have high network latency) doesn't even really look good (I bet you know what I'm talking about, don't you? I bet a lot of you have seen the frozen screen, too).

The ScreenSubject pattern was introduced to my project last week and what can I say: I'm pretty happy to have it in our application ;-)
