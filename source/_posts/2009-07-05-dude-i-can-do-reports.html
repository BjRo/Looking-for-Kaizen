<p>Over the past days I finally managed to spend some time with <em>xUnit.BDDExtensions</em>. I can't possibly describe how good coming back to <em>xUnit.net</em> feels after working with <em>MSTest</em> in my last project. The speed, the extensibility model.&#160; It's simply not comparable. <em>MSTest</em> is certainly a great tool in case you haven't worked with a unit test framework before and it's integration into Visual Studio is definitely a plus, too. However once you've got <em>Resharper</em> or <em>Gallio</em> installed the integration aspect isn't really the big deal any more. Anyway, you can find several changes in the current trunk (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/xunitbddextensions/" target="_blank">(http://code.google.com/p/xunitbddextensions/)</a>. </p>  <h4>The biggest addition is the new ReportGenerator</h4>  <p>I've wanted this for quite a while now but never really found the time to implement it. After running the <em>RunBuild.cmd</em> in the &quot;Build&quot; folder of the trunk you'll find the .exe in the &quot;Deploy&quot; folder. It's still a bit raw but exactly what I need for my current client (yes, you heard right. <em>xUnit.BDDExtensions</em> is currently being picked up at my current client ;-)) </p>  <p>Here are the current console arguments: </p>  <p><em>/assembly</em> configures the spec assembly to extract a report from one or more assemblies. </p>  <blockquote>   <p>ReportGenerator.exe /assembly:SomeSpecAssembly      <br />ReportGenerator.exe /assembly:C:\Test\SomeSpecAssembly.dll       <br />ReportGenerator.exe /assembly:'C:\Path with spaces\SomeSpecAssembly.dll' ReportGenerator.exe /assembly:SomeSpecAssembly /assembly:SomeOtherSpecAssembly</p> </blockquote>  <p><em>/generator</em> configures the generator to use. There are currently two generators implemented. One building an ASCII .txt file which looks like <a href="http://www.bjoernrochel.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/xunitbddextensionsreportingspecs.txt" target="_blank">this</a>. In order to use it you have to run the generator with </p>  <blockquote>   <p>ReportGenerator.exe /assembly:SomeSpecAssembly /generator:Text </p> </blockquote>  <p>The other creating an HTML file which looks like <a href="http://www.bjoernrochel.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/xunitbddextensionsreportingspecs.html" target="_blank">this</a>. This is the default generator which is used when you omit the <em>/generator</em> argument. </p>  <p>The files created by the generator are created on a per assembly basis and named like the assembly with the suffix .html or .txt. By default they are created in the same directory the generator is run from. </p>  <p>You can change this by configuring a different folder via <em>/path</em>. </p>  <blockquote>   <p>ReportGenerator.exe /assembly:C:\Test\SomeSpecAssembly.dll /path:C:\temp </p> </blockquote>  <h3>   <br /></h3>  <h4>The deployment has changed slightly</h4>  <p>The build script now merges <em>xUnit.BDDExtensions</em> to a single assembly (the external Rhino.Mocks assembly is not needed any more). Same applies to the <em>ReportGenerator</em> which uses <em>StructureMap</em> and <em>NVelocity</em> internally.    <br /></p>  <h4>Some small changes to the API </h4>  <ul>   <li><em>Dependency&lt;TDependency&gt;()</em> has been marked as obsolete in <em>InstanceContextSpecification&lt;T&gt;</em> and <em>StaticContextSpecification</em>. </li>    <li><em>AutoDependency&lt;TDependency&gt;()</em> has been marked as obsolete in <em>InstanceContextSpecification&lt;T&gt;</em>. </li>    <li><em>An&lt;TDependency&gt;() and </em><em>Some&lt;TDependency&gt;()</em> have been added to both <em>InstanceCOntextSpecification&lt;T&gt;</em> and <em>StaticContextSpecification</em>. </li>    <li><em>The&lt;TDependency&gt;() has been added to <em>InstanceCOntextSpecification&lt;T&gt;</em></em>, </li> </ul>  <p>Its mostly naming which has been changed. Some discussions at my current client made me realize that    <br />it's easier to describe the behavior of xUnit.BDDExtensions to developers who haven't used the tool before with <em>An&lt;ICar&gt;()</em> in favor of <em>Dependency&lt;ICar&gt;()</em> and <em>The&lt;ICar&gt;()</em> in favor of <em>AutoDependency&lt;ICar&gt;()</em>. </p>  <p><em>An&lt;TDependency&gt;() </em>returns a new dynamic stub object every time it's called. <em>The&lt;TDependency&gt;()</em> behaves differently. BDDExtensions has AutoMocking support built-in. Once you let the framework create your test object you're able to access the automatically injected dynamic stubs with this method. Last but not least <em>Some&lt;TDependency&gt;()</em> provides the same behavior as <em>An&lt;T&gt;()</em>. It only returns a collection of newly created stub objects. </p>  <p>I'm going to write a more detailed documentation of the current version soon. So in case you're interested in the BDDExtensions, stay tuned . . . </p>
