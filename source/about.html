So you found your way to this blog and maybe wonder "Who the hell is this guy?".

The last version of this page was full of  details about previous positions, projects, employers etc. Stuff that I currently consider not that important. If you're still interested in this level of detail, take a look <a href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Bjoern_Rochel" target="_blank">at this XING page</a>.

In short: A 31 years old guy who fell in love with building software VERY, VERY late at the age of 20, but managed to learn quite a bit in those years due to lots and lots of passion for software development. Continous learning &amp; seeking ways for improvement in any dimension (code, teams and delivery process)  is what drives me every day by day. Trying to be the best I can be.  Always looking for ways to get better. Never 100% pleased.

Currently I'm making my living as a consultant for .NET rich clients and software testing topics for one of the major German consulting companies.

This blog is first and foremost one of my personal learning tools. It's often not as focussed as I wish it to be, as there're so many things I'm interested in and time for writing is so limited. Nevertheless I hope you can take at least some bits of information from it.

In that sense: <strong>Develop with passion (stolen from JP) and make the most of your professional now</strong>
